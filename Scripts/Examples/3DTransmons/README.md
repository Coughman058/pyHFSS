This example shows how to use pyHFSS on a simple 3D transmon in a cavity, where we sweep LJ.

1. Clone pyHFSS
2. Run the optimetrics sweep of the HFSS simulation
3. Set rootdir in config_bbq and project/design names in main.py of this example
4. Compile. You should see a plot of Hamiltonian parameters vs LJ. In rootdir, you should find the corresponding database values
